## Reason for late submission

We had to get a later deadline for the third release of the project. We tried to keep a tight schedule and start early on the third release but we still underestimated the work needed to be done. 
Especially making the project shippable proved to be quite hard and time consuming. Problem like that would also be less disruptive for a group of four as we have less brain- and manpower to deal with the 
problem.
