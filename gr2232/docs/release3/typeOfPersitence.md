The program utilizes two diferent types percistence.

Upon selecting to use local storage (non REST), the user has the ability to click on the settings tab. Here, the user can specify a filename to save the current state of the program to a local JSON-file, or load the state of a previous session. This is using a desktop methaphor for saving/persistence, because you save or load in an explicit fashion. 

Upon selecting remote storage (REST), the user does not have access to the settings tab. The user is therefor not able to explicitly save or load a session. The program fetches the state of the previous session from the REST-API, and does not save a local JSON file. The program adds units, tenants etc progressivly to the session if the REST-server accepts the request to do such actions. Using REST the persistence is done in an implicit fashion.
