### **A system for managing storage units!**

Our program is meant to work as a system for managing units in a units warehouse.

This means that the bussiness owner/manager can in the program:

1. Register the amount of units 
2. View leased out and free units. 
3. Lease out units or remove tenanats from units. 

The usercharacters used in this project can be read [here](brukerhistorier.md)

Most of the logic/code of the program is in [gr2232/src/main/java/gr2232](gr2232/src/main/java/gr2232) 

Under is a low-fidelity wireframe of the program. It also shows the flow of the program (from top to bottom).
