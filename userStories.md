# Userstories

There will be made an application in which a user can manage units in an unit storage house. This means that the application will be used by businesses  that rent out units in a unit storage house. The users of this application can logically be seperated in two: 
1. Manager/admin 
2. Employee

## Manager/admin (us-1)

As an Admin/Manager I would like to have a view of all the units and their status. 

As an Admin/Manager I have the need to add units in the application with their respective size. I also require that I can rent out an unit. It is also important that I can completely delete an unit from the application since a unit might need to be fixed or rehabilitated and therefore will not be avaliable. 

### Important to see:

- All the units in the application
- Status of an unit: rented or not. 

### Important to do: 

- Adding new units
- Deleting an unit
- Adding a tenant to an unit
- Removing a tenant from an unit

## Employee (us-2)

As an employee I would like to see all the units that are in the application. 

I would also like to see the status of an unit. To do my job it is also important that I can rent out an unit. 

### Important to see:

- All the units in the application
- Status of an unit: rented or not. 

### Important to do:

- Adding a tenant to an unit
- Removing a tenant from an unit
